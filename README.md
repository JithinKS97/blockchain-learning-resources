# Blockchain learning resources

This are some of the best resources that I have found that give an introduction to blockchain technology from first principles.

1. [Foundations of blockchains](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEGCF-WLh2RLOHv_xUGLqRts_9JxrckiA) by [Tim Roughgarden](http://timroughgarden.org/)
2. [Introduction to cyrptocurrency](https://nakamoto.com/introduction-to-cryptocurrency/) by [Haseeb Qureshi](https://haseebq.com/)
3. [Defi course from Snowball](https://docs.snowball.network/welcome/readme)
